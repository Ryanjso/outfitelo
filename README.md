# Outfit ELO

This is a unofficial project that lets the public compare meta gala outfits. It uses ELO ratings to determine the best outfit(s) based on the public's votes.

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
